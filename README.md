It is possible you may have to zoom in or out depending on which screen resoluton you are using.

The stories we hear about sharks are numerous and more often than not they teach us to be afraid of Sharks.
But just how afraid should we be. Should we believe any of the stories? Making scary films about sharks has become a multi million dollar industry. The truth is people are very seldom attacked by Sharks. Sharks normaly feed on fish how ever occasionally Sharks have been spotted close to the coast sometimes in bathing areas, some say it may have to do with the rise in temperature. What ever we want to believe it is worth taking a look at real statistics. With a few searches we were able to find some data here:
https://knoema.com/lftyaag/confirmed-unprovoked-shark-attacks-around-the-world?action=export&gadget=visualization
http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
This dashboard shows proportionally and numerically how many unproked shark attacks have been registered since 1503. If we had based the charts on the number of fatalities we would not have much to show.

#### Features
This project pulls it's data from a JSON file which was downloaded as a csv file
https://knoema.com/lftyaag/confirmed-unprovoked-shark-attacks-around-the-world?action=export&gadget=visualization# which was then converted to JSON format. This was done using this website:
http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm

By clicking on the pie chart or the bar chart the dc.crossfilter kicks in and the surrounding charts will dymamically
respond accordingly.
 
#### Features Left to Implement
other interesting information about Sharks,
Photo library.

#### Technologies Used
Html, CSS, javascript libraries: dc and d3.

#### This project uses the following libraries:
- [dc,js](https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) a dimensional charting javascrpt library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets.

- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

I wrote the CSS to create the dashboard. It has only been tested on a google browser. Note this dash board is not intended to be responsive.
The background image was edited in photoshop by yours truly (that is me by the way).

#### Deployment
Shark Facts - dash board was deployed on github pages, information about this can be found here:

#### Tests
This page reaches the full requirements of w3.org
https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsteviebolton.github.io%2Fapi-data-visualisation-project%2F
it has also been checked using Google developer tools.
